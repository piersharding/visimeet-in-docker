Visimeet on Ubuntu
====================

Build and run visimeet in a Docker 14.04 container.

You must have Docker installed first - https://docs.docker.com/install/ .

This has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 - YMMV

Run ./build.sh to build the Docker image.

Run ./run.sh to run visimeet in a container against your uid and $HOME.
